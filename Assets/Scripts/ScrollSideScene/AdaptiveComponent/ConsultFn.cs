	//This function retrieves heart rate data from the local database and execute some intelligence on it so any exergame scenario can take advantage of it.
	//It runs continuosly, even between scenarios( period of time after any scenario has finished, but before any other starts running.) Ok we could improve this by 
	//adding more states in which nothing happens more than stoping to call this consult() class.

	// Use this for initialization
